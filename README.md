<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Creating your first "Mocha-Algorithms" project

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project, you need:

- A GitHub account
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code or any other code editor of your preference

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder using GitHub CLI or HTTPS:
<br>
```sh
  cd your-folder
  git clone git@github.com:RileyManda/Mocha-Algorithms.git
  gh repo clone RileyManda/mocha-algorithms
```

# .gitignore
node_modules/


**NOTE:** If you are using Windows, make sure you initialize npm to create `package.json` file.

```
npm init -y
```

1. Run
   ```
   npm i 
   ```
   _how to use npm: (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)._
2. Run tests
 ```
   npm test 
   ```
3. **Do not make any changes in package.json file - each package.json already has a mocha library installed.And the default project name will be used by linters as a future feature for the github workflows..**
   - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
4. Run
   ```
   npx hint .
   ```
5. Fix validation errors.
