## Description

You are given a task to count the number of people in a room. Your goal is to write an algorithm that takes a list of names representing the people in the room and returns the count of people.

## Test Cases

### Test 1 - Empty Room

**Input:** An empty list of names, indicating that the room is empty.

**Expected Output:** The count of people should be 0 since there are no names in the list.

### Test 2 - Non-Empty Room

**Input:** A list of names containing several names of people in the room.

**Expected Output:** The count of people should be the total number of names in the list.

### Test 3 - Increment for Two People

**Input:** A list of names containing exactly two names.

**Expected Output:** The count of people should be the number of names in the list plus 1. Since there are two people in the room, the count should be incremented by 1.

## Implementation

Remember, you need to come up with an algorithm that can handle different scenarios and return the correct count of people in the room based on the given list of names.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the tests to verify the correctness of your algorithm.
